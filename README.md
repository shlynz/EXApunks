## My EXApunks Solutions
**DISCLAIMER: I very much encourage you to try and solve everything by yourself first. Not only because my solutions aren't great so you won't even score good with them, but mainly because it voids the experience/satisfaction of solving the tasks your own way.**
The structure of this repository is based on the given hostname of each level. For example, the tutorial levels all connect to the `TRASH WORLD NEWS` network and are thus each a subfolder of the `TRASH WORLD NEWS` folder.
```
MISSIONS
    └─  NETWORK NAME
    |   └─  MISSION NAME
    |       |   EXA NAME
    |       |   EXA NAME
    └─  NETWORK NAME
    |   └─  MISSION NAME
    |       |   EXA NAME
    |       |   EXA NAME

```
The EXA files use the code highlighting extension `pizzafox.exa-syntax-highlighting` for VSCode:

#### Hacker Battle
My Hacker Battle solutions do not follow this convention, these are just grouped in the folder with the same name, with the name of the mission as name of the subfolders. These solutions are currently just very lazy, quick-and-dirty solutions against the NPCs, maybe I'll update them once I play against friends. The current ones just do the objective and kill the enemy EXA if they are passing by.
